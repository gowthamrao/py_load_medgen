==========
README file for MedGen https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/medgen/

Last updated: November 6, 2024

  There are multiple files maintained by NCBI that are related to medical genetics.
This README summarizes files available by ftp not only in the medgen path, but also
on other paths.

  Note that MedGen anchors information to the value known as CUI, so most of these
reports include the defining CUI. When the value of CUI is the letter C followed by integers,
the value corresponds to a record from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). When the value
of CUI are the letters CN followed by integers, the value was created by NCBI,
because a corresponding concept from UMLS was not identified.

  MedGen assigns an internal unique identifier to each record, the UID. The web site reports the
MedGen UID. The file that maps CUI to the UID reported on the web page is MedGen_UID_CUI_history.txt.


  This file has two major sections.
    First is a description, by path, of the files and their contents/
	 Second are some suggestions about how the files can be used to extract data for
selected uses.


*************************Summary of files***************************************

MedGen
======
  Files in the medgen directory are updated weekly, on Wednesdays.
  Each .RRF file is structured according to the following conventions:

 * A vertical bar (|) is used as delimiter
 * The first line in each file begins with a hash (#) and provides the column names.

  When appropriate, names of the columns are consistent with those used by UMLS. Many of
the values come from UMLS as well (fields with names in lower case have no counterpart in UMLS).
  These documents also provide more information about the terms used by UMLS in its data files
  (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/release/abbreviations.html,
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9676/,
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9685/)
  Note that UMLS names its files starting with MR; MedGen names the corresponding files starting with MG.

  Files with a .gz suffix have been compressed using 'gzip'. To read these files, save
the .gz file locally and then extract the file using the software of your choice.

File: MedGenIDMappings.txt.gz
-----------------------------
Summary data for MedGen's assigned CUI^, preferred name and other source database identifiers.
MedGen has many data sources and aligns these ontologies and vocabularies to represent unified disease concepts.
In this effort, MedGen tries to assign 1:1 identifiers to a record (CUI). However, some sources map to more than one concept. For example, UMLS may split a single MeSH ID across multiple CUIs, we report all valid mappings from UMLS.
The various identifiers are mapped to a CUI and MedGen's preferred name for the concept.

(^Note- When the value of CUI is the letter C followed by integers, the value corresponds to a record from
Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). When the value of CUI are the letters CN followed by integers, the value
was created by NCBI, because a corresponding concept from UMLS was not identified.)

 * CUI_or_CN_id:     	concept unique identifier
 * pref_name:		MedGen's preferred name
 * source_id:		the identifier from the source
 * source: 		abbreviated name for the source

Sources reported:

Some of the files are split to allow loading into spreadsheet software (maximum 1,000,000 lines per file). The csv files also facilitate processing of the MGDEF.RRF file because the DEF column may contain internal line feeds.

***************************Selected applications*********************************
1. Determine how the CUI assigned by MedGen to an identifier from another database may
have changed over time.

a. Use HPO_CUI_history.txt to look for the CUI assigned to IDs from HPO. Each assignment is
   reported on a distinct line.
	Note that not all HPO ids will have a value of 1 in the IsCurrent column. Some
	HPO ids will have been retired.  You can find the current mapping by searching the
	file for the last CUI that had been assigned.

      grep HP:0100805 HPO_CUI_history.txt
        HP:0100805      C0025322        12 Jun 2019     0

      grep C0025322 HPO_CUI_history.txt  (search for C0025322 which was last used June 2019)

        HP:0008209      C0025322        30 Oct 2019     1

b. use ORDO_CUI_history.txt to look for the CUI assigned to IDs from Orphanet and the ORDO ontology.
   Each assignment is reported on a distinct line.
	Note that not all Orphanet identifiers will have a value of 1 in the IsCurrent column. Some
	will have been retired.  You can find the current mapping by searching the file for the last CUI
	that had been assigned.
